The aim of this project was to create a call-logging program that produces a daily phone call report with the follwoing details:
    -> a list of who called and from what phone number
    -> the total talking time for each phone number 
    -> the total daily talking time


This is an ongoing personal project to improve my programming skills, and to be used as the basis for a larger project in the future.
It is more of a 'proof of concept' than a finished project.
